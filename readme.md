### Installation
Download the contents of this repository, then double-click the `AlignTo.sketchplugin` bundle.

### How to use

1. Select some layers
2. Run the plugin by going to `Plugins > 🦁 A Lion Layers`
3. Specify which layer you want to be the key layer by selecting it from the list of layers
4. Select the alignment type that you want to apply
5. Click Align to apply the alignment modification

### Tips
1. You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to quickly change the selected layer (Up/Down arrows) and the alignment type (Left/Right arrows)
2. If you just select two layers and you want to quickly invert the key object, hold down control when selecting an alignment type. If you select more than two layers the plugin window will be shown allowing you to specify a key layer.
